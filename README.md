# DDoS Attack Detection Software

##  Introduction

This is a **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** attack detection software developed as part of a course project.  
The system utilizes packet analysis and network traffic inspection techniques to detect abnormal behavior caused by DDoS attacks.

##  Objectives

- Capture and process network traffic data
- Apply threshold-based analysis techniques to detect DDoS attacks
- Classify DoS and DDoS attacks
- Provide a user-friendly interface for real-time traffic monitoring and alerting
- Scalable and suitable for integration into real network environments
